# CPP_Challenges
CPP Challenges for practice. The problems have been collected from different web pages, I resolve them using C++ and Cmake. It has compiled with GCC in [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). I use Unit Test: [googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest) library.
